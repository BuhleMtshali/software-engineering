## 🌟 Day 3: FizzBuzz Mini Game 👾🎮

Welcome to Day 3 of my Software Engineering journey — where loops met logic and FizzBuzz caught these hands 🧠💥

- Today’s mission was simple on paper, chaotic in execution:

👉 Master for loops and conditionals

👉 Build the legendary FizzBuzz

👉 Make it fun, noisy, and impossible to ignore

- And guess what? Mission accomplished 😌✨

🎯 What I Focused On Today

🔁 Writing for loops that actually make sense

🧠 Using modulus (%) to detect patterns

🚦 Chaining if / else if / else conditions cleanly

⏳ Adding a tiny delay with setTimeout for ✨drama✨

🖥️ Building another CLI-based mini game


## 🧪 Project: Mini FizzBuzz Game

🔍 How It Works

1. User enters a maximum number

2. The program loops from 0 → maxIterator

3. For each number:

    - 🎊 FizzBuzz → divisible by 3 and 5

    - 🧩 Fizz → divisible by 3

    - 🐝 Buzz → divisible by 5

    - 🗑️ Otherwise… that number did not survive

4. All results are printed directly to the terminal with ✨vibes✨.


## 📆 Day 3 Dev Breakdown

| 🔢 Step | 💡 Concept   | 🎯 Implementation      | 🔥 Vibe                  |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1️⃣     | User Input   | Ask for max iterator   | “Choose your destiny” 🎮 |
| 2️⃣     | For Loop     | Loop from 0 → max      | Loop supremacy 🔁        |
| 3️⃣     | Modulus `%`  | Check divisibility     | Math but make it cool 🧮 |
| 4️⃣     | Conditionals | Fizz / Buzz / FizzBuzz | Logic unlocked 🧠        |
| 5️⃣     | CLI Output   | Emojis + console logs  | Terminal drip 😤         |


## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

☕ JavaScript (ES6+)

🖥️ Node.js

🎤 prompt-sync for user input

⏳ setTimeout() for dramatic effect

## 🧠 What I Learned

By the end of today, I can:

✅ Confidently write for loops

✅ Use % to detect number patterns

✅ Structure clean conditional logic

✅ Build interactive CLI games

✅ Add personality to code (important) 😌


```💬 “FizzBuzz isn’t hard — thinking like a developer is.” ```
