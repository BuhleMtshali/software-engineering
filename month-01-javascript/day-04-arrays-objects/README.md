## 🐝 Mini Inventory Tracker 📦🎰

A chaotic-good CLI project for practicing real JavaScript logic

Welcome to my Mini Inventory Tracker — a command-line app where I play shopkeeper, accountant, and software engineer all at once 😌💻

This project is all about arrays of objects, loops, switch statements, and user input — aka the bread & butter of JavaScript logic.

- No frameworks.

- No UI.

- Just vibes, logic, and emojis. 🐝✨

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- This CLI app lets a user:

    - 📋 View all inventory items

    - 📦 Add new products

    - 🎲 Remove products

    - 🔎 Search for specific items

    - 🚪 Exit the program gracefully

- All powered by pure JavaScript and prompt-sync

## 🕹️ How the Game Works (Flow)

1️⃣ User is shown a menu

2️⃣ User selects an option

3️⃣ App performs the action

4️⃣ User can keep making transactions until they say “nah” 😎

- It loops until you’re DONE-done.

## 🧩 Features Breakdown

📋 View Inventory

- Displays all stored products

- Shows:

    - Item name

    - Quantity

    - Price

    - Total cost

- Handles empty inventory like a champ 🫡

## 📦 Add Item

- User enters:

    - Product name

    - Quantity

    - Price

- App calculates total automatically 🧠✨

- Stores everything as an object inside an array

## 🎲 Remove Item

- User enters product name

- App:

    - Searches the array

    - Removes the item if it exists

    - Gives feedback either way (no silent failures 😤)

## 🔎 Search Item

- Finds a product by name

- Displays full item details

- Safely handles “item not found” (no crashes, no tears 😌)

## 🚪 Exit

- Clean exit

- Friendly goodbye

- Emotional closure 😭💖

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

🟨 JavaScript (Node.js)

⌨️ CLI (Terminal life)

📦 prompt-sync

🧠 Arrays & Objects

🔁 While loops

🔀 Switch statements

## ▶️ How to Run It

```
npm install prompt-sync
node index.js

```
- Boom. You’re officially an inventory manager 🧾😤

## 🧠 What I Practiced & Learned

✅ Arrays of objects

✅ find() vs findIndex()

✅ Adding & removing data safely

✅ Loop control with while

✅ Input validation

✅ Writing logic-heavy programs

✅ Thinking like a developer, not just a coder

## 🚀 Future Glow-Ups (Coming Soon™)

🧾 Update item quantities

💾 Save inventory to file

📊 Inventory totals & stats

🔁 Rebuild this in Python & Java

🎨 Maybe one day… a UI 👀

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This isn’t “just a mini project”.

This is logic training, problem-solving, and muscle memory for real-world dev work.

One repo.
Multiple languages.
Same logic.

That’s the plan. That’s the grind. 🐝🔥
