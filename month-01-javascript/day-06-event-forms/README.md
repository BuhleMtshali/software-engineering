# 📝 Day 6: Feedback Form (Events + Forms) 🎯✨

Welcome to **Day 6** of my Full-Stack Software Engineering journey 🚀  
Today was all about **forms that actually think**, buttons that behave, and JavaScript doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes 🧠⚙️

This project simulates a **real-world feedback form** where users can submit their details, choose a category, rate an experience, and leave feedback — all handled cleanly with vanilla JS 💅

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

✅ Collects user details (name + email)  
✅ Allows category selection via `<select>`  
✅ Uses interactive rating buttons (1–5 ⭐)  
✅ Ensures **only one rating can be selected**  
✅ Validates all fields before submission  
✅ Logs clean, structured feedback to the console  
✅ Resets state after successful submission  

Basically: **frontend logic done right** 😎

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- 📟 DOM Selection & Traversal  
- 🧩 Event Handling (`click`, `submit`)  
- 🧼 Form Validation  
- 🎯 State Management (selected rating)  
- 🎨 Dynamic Class Toggling  
- 🧠 Separating UI logic from submission logic

## 🖱️ How It Works (User Flow)

1️⃣ User enters full name & email  
2️⃣ Selects a feedback category  
3️⃣ Clicks **one** rating button (1–5)  
4️⃣ Types feedback message  
5️⃣ Submits the form  
6️⃣ App validates + logs everything  
7️⃣ Form resets like nothing happened ✨

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Buttons ≠ inputs (state matters)
- Forms should validate before acting
- Global state beats event chaos
- One active button > many confused ones
- Vanilla JS is more powerful than it looks 💪

## 🚀 What’s Next

➡️ Persist feedback with `localStorage`  
➡️ Send feedback to a backend API  
➡️ Replace alerts with UI messages  
➡️ Rebuild this in React later 😏
