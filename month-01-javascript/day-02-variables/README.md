## 🌟 Day 2: Age Calculator CLI ⏳💻

### 👋🏾 Heyyy! Welcome to Day 2 of my Full-Stack coding glow-up!

- Today, I took a dive into loops, conditionals, and the Date object in JavaScript — and ended up building a CLI Age Calculator that actually makes sense of your years, months, and days. No more guessing your age like it’s a math mystery! 🧠✨

## 🎯 What I’m Doing Today

🖥️ CLI input/output with prompt-sync

🔄 Using while loops to rerun the calculator until the user says “no”

🧮 Conditionals to handle invalid input and logic for age calculation

📅 Manipulating the Date object to calculate accurate years, months, and days

💡 Handling tricky cases like birthdays that haven’t happened yet this year

## 📆 Daily Dev Dose (Day 2)

| ------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1️⃣     | Prompt-sync CLI | Ask user for name, birth year, month, day          | “Let’s talk age” 🤓      |
| 2️⃣     | While Loops     | Keep calculator running if user wants to try again | “Loop baby loop” 🔄      |
| 3️⃣     | Conditionals    | Validate input & check birthday logic              | Brain flex 🧠💪          |
| 4️⃣     | Date Object     | Calculate age in years, months, and days           | Time traveler vibes ⏳    |
| 5️⃣     | Console Output  | Show nicely formatted age                          | Instant gratification 😎 |


## 💫 What I Built

🎯 Age Calculator CLI

    - Asks for your name

    - Asks for your birth year, month, and day

    - Calculates years, months, and days accurately

    - Handles edge cases (birthday hasn’t happened yet)

    - Loops until you decide to quit


## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

☕ JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🧠 What I’ll Walk Away With

By the end of this day, I’ll:

✅ Be comfortable with while loops and conditional logic

✅ Manipulate JavaScript Dates like a pro

✅ Create interactive CLI apps that loop & validate input

✅ Understand edge cases like upcoming birthdays

```💬 "Time waits for no one, but my age calculator sure does!" 🕰️```
