## ⚛️ Month 2: React Era Activated ⚡

### (React Fundamentals → Advanced Hooks)

Welcome to Month 2, where I stop poking the DOM manually and let React do the heavy lifting 💪🏾

This month is all about components, state, reactivity, and building UIs that actually scale.

- If Month 1 taught me how JavaScript thinks —

- Month 2 teaches me how applications think 🧠⚛️

## 🎯 What I’m Doing This Month

- ⚛️ Learning React from first principles

- 🧩 Breaking UIs into reusable components

- 📦 Managing state, props, and events

- 🔁 Rendering dynamic lists & conditional UI

- 🪝 Going deep into Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)

- 🌍 Fetching external data into React apps

- 🧠 Thinking in component architecture, not pages
